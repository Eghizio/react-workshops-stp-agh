1. Getting ready (Cleanup Vite & Prepare empty project)
2. Hello JSX (App returning `string` â†’ App returning `JSX`)
3. First component (Extracting JSX to separate component)
4. React Fragment (Component must return a single element + Shorthand)
5. This is getting out of hand. Now there are two of them! - Reusing component
   (Multiple instances of our component)
6. Let it flow - Customising components (Props & Interfaces + Destructuring props + Children)
7. Static data (Data outside of component + Separate data files)
8. Sprinkling JavaScript into our JSX (Curly braces and functions in JSX)
9. What if? - Conditional rendering (Ternary operator and &&)
10. Loops - Rendering multiple components
    (Mapping over data to render many components)
11. A Key to success (`key` prop & How React knows the order)
12. A Pointless Button, or is it? - Event handling
    (Event handling + String interpolation with template literals + Inline functions)
13. Wait a minute! Who are you? - Title and Favicon (Static & Public assets)
